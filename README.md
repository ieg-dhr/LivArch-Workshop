<b>Template Demo</b>: https://martinadellobuono.github.io/academicevent-template/

The <b>Academic Event Template</b> has been designed and developed by Martina Dello Buono to create your own academic event web page to promote your event.

It is very simple and quick to customize. You will find the following files.

<ol>
  <li><b>index.html</b> - It is the backbone file which define the structure of the website itself. It is provided with all the CDNs/links used to   call the external sources used, namely:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/" target="_blank" alt="Google Fonts website">Bootstrap 3.3.7</a> - Also the         Bootstrap .js is already included.</li>
      <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" alt="Google Fonts website">Google Fonts</a> - You can customize your web page fonts       accessing Google Fonts website and embedding the specific code of the fonts you like in index.html Academic Event Template file.</li>
      <li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank" alt="Google Fonts website">Font Awesome</a> - You can customize your icons in the web       page choosing them in Font Awesome icon set.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>style.css</b>.</li>
  <li><b>main.js</b> - This file is written in jQuery. jQuery reference is included in index.html. Only two fuctions are written in pure             JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

You will find also two folders:
<ol>
  <li><b>doc-download</b> - This folder has to include all the files you want the user to download from your web page.</li>
  <li><b>img</b> - This folder has to include all the images you want to show in your web page, including a photo for each relator, just in case     you want them to be visualized by the users. To show the photos of the relators, you have to assign an id to each corresponding image container,   then recall it in your .css and applies "background-image" property. For all the relators who do not want to show their face, a placeholder icon       called "user.png" and a class "no-user" to insert in index.html instead of the relator's id are included. All the logos and an image for your     homepage background have to be contained in this folder.</li>
</ol> 

In the code itself, you will also find some comments to lines to help you in your job.

Have a good time!
